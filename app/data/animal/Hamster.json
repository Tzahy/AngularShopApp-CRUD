The subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera.[1] They have become established as popular small house pets,[2] and partly because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals.","name":"Hamster","age":"1","price":"25","imageUrl":"http://s1.picswalls.com/wallpapers/2014/07/17/hamster-hd_110540547_51.jpg","id":"Hamster"}
